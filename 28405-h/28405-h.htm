its designs, in the most convenient form, and
at the least possible expense consistent with
the production of useful volumes.</p>

<h3>DRYDEN ON SHAKSPERE.</h3>

<blockquote><p><i>"Dryden may be properly considered as the father of
English criticism, as the writer who first taught us to
determine upon principles the merit of composition."</i>&mdash;Samuel
<span class="smcap">Johnson</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>No one of the early prose testimonies to the
genius of Shakspere has been more admired than
that which bears the signature of John Dryden.
I must transcribe it, accessible as it is elsewhere,
for the sake of its juxtaposition with a less-known
metrical specimen of the same nature.</p>

<blockquote><p>"He [Shakspere] was the man who of all modern,
and perhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most
comprehensive soul. All the images of nature were
still present to him, and he drew them not laboriously,
but luckily: when he describes any thing, you more
than see it, you feel it too. Those who accuse him to
have wanted learning, give him the greater commendation:
he was naturally learned; he needed not
the spectacles of books to read nature; he looked inwards,
and found her there. I cannot say he is every
where alike; were he so, I should do him injury to
compare him with the greatest of mankind. He is
many times flat, insipid; his comic wit degenerating
into clenches, his serious swelling into bombast. But
he is always great when some great occasion is presented
to him: no man can say he ever had a fit subject
for his wit, and did not then raise himself as high
above the rest of poets,</p>

<p>The metrical specimen shall now take its place.

<p class="i0"><i>Covent Garden drolery</i>, London, 1672. 8<sup>o</sup> p. 9.</p>
</div></div>

<p>A short historical comment on the above extracts
is all that must be expected. The rest shall
be left to the critical discernment of those persons
who may be attracted by the heading of this Note&mdash;<i>Dryden
on Shakspere</i>.</p>

<p>When Johnson wrote his preface to Shakspere,
he quoted the <i>first</i> of the above extracts to prove
that the plays were once admired without the aid
of comment. This was written in 1765. In 1769
Garrick placed the same extract at the head of his
collection of <i>undeniable</i> prose-testimonies to the
genius of Shakspere. Johnson afterwards pronounced
it to be "a perpetual model of encomiastic
criticism;" and Malone quoted it as an
<i>admirable character</i> of Shakspere. Now, <i>admirable</i>
as it is, I doubt if it can be considered as
expressive of the deliberate opinion of Dryden.
The essayist himself, in his epistolary address to
lord Buckhurst, gives a caution on that point.
He observes, "All I have said is problematical."
In short, the essay <i>Of dramatick poesie</i> is in the
form of a dialogue&mdash;and a dialogue is "a chace
of wit kept up on both sides."</p>

<p>I proceed to the second extract.&mdash;Who wrote
the <i>Prologue to Julius Cæsar</i>? To what master-hand
are we to ascribe this twofold specimen of
psychologic portraiture? Take up the dramatic
histories of Langbaine and Baker; take up the
<i>Theatrical register</i> of the reverend Charles Burney;
take up the voluminous <i>Some account</i> of the
reverend John Genest; examine the mass of commendatory
verses in the twenty-one-volume editions
of Shakspere; examine also the commendatory
verses in the nine-volume edition of Ben.
Jonson. Here is the result: Langbaine calls
attention to the prologue in question as an <i>excellent
prologue</i>, and Genest repeats what had been
said one hundred and forty years before by
Langbaine. There is not the slightest hint on
its authorship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96">{96}</a></span>
I must therefore leave the stronghold of facts,
and advance into the of conjecture. <i>I ascribe
the prologue to John Dryden.</i></p>

<p>It appears by the list of plays altered from
Shakspere, as drawn up by Steevens and Reed,
that <i>Julius Cæsar</i> had been altered by sir William
D'Avenant and Dryden jointly, and acted at the
Theatre-royal in Drury-lane. It would therefore
seem probable that one of those poets wrote the
<i>prologue</i> on that occasion. Nevertheless, it does
not appear in the works of either poet.</p>

<p>The <i>Works</i> of sir William D'Avenant were
edited by Mr. Herringman, with the sanction of
lady D'Avenant, in 1673; and its exclusion so
far decides the question.</p>

<p>The non-appearance of it in the <i>Poems</i> of
Dryden, as published by Mr. Tonson in 1701, is
no disproof of the claim which I advocate. The
volume contains only twenty prologues and epilogues&mdash;but
Dryden wrote <i>twice</i> that number!</p>

<p>I shall now produce some circumstantial evidence
in favour of Dryden. It is derived from an
examination of the volume entitled <i>Covent Garden
drolery</i>. This small volume contains twenty-two
prologues or epilogues, and more than fifty songs&mdash;all
anonymous, but said to be written by the
<i>refinedest wits of the age</i>. We have, 1. A prologue
and epilogue to the <i>Maiden queen</i> of Dryden&mdash;not
those printed in 1668; 2. A prologue and
epilogue to the <i>Parson's wedding</i> of Thomas Killigrew;
3. A prologue and epilogue to the <i>Marriage
à la mode</i> of Dryden&mdash;printed with the
play in 1673; 4. The prologue to <span class="smcap">Julius Cæsar</span>;
5. A prologue to the <i>Wit without money</i> of Beaumont
and Fletcher&mdash;printed in the <i>Poems</i> of
Dryden, 1701; 6. A prologue to the <i>Pilgrim</i> of
Fletcher&mdash;not that printed in 1700. These pieces
occupy the first twelve pages of the volume. It
cannot be requisite to give any further account of
its contents.</p>

<p>I waive the question of internal evidence; but
have no misgiving, on that score, as to the opinion
which may henceforth prevail on the validity of
the claim now advanced in favour of Dryden.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott observes, with reference to
the essay <i>Of dramatick poesie</i>, "The contrast of
Ben. Jonson and Shakspere is peculiarly and
strikingly felicitous." He could have said no less&mdash;whatever
he might have said as to its authorship&mdash;had
he seen the <i>Prologue to Julius Cæsar</i>.</p>

<h3>PARTY SIMILES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY:&mdash;NO.
I. "FOXES AND FIREBRANDS." NO. II. "THE
TROJAN HORSE."</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. viii., p. 488.)</p>

<p>The following works I omitted to mention in
my last Note from want of room. The first
is by that <i>amiable</i> Nimrod, John Bale, Bishop of
Ossory:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Yet a Course at the Romyshe Foxe, &amp;c. Compyled
by Johan Harrison. Zurich. 1543. 4to."</p></blockquote>

<p>The four following are by William Turner,
M.D., who also wrote under an assumed name:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Huntyng of the Romishe Foxe, &amp;c. By
William Wraughton. Basil. 1543."</p>

<p>"The Rescuynge of the Romishe Foxe, &amp;c. Winchester.
1545. 8vo."</p>

<p>"The Huntyng of the Romyshe Wolfe. 8vo.
1554(?)."</p>

<p>"The Huntyng of the Foxe and Wolfe, &amp;c. 8vo."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next is the most important work, and I
give the title in full:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Hunting of the Romish Fox, and the Quenching
of Sectarian <i>Firebrands</i>. Being a Specimen of
Popery and Separation. Collected by the Honourable
Sir James Ware, Knight, out of the Memorials of
Eminent Men, both in Church and State: A. B.
Cranmer, A. B. Usher, A. B. Parker, Sir Henry
Sidney, A. B. Abbot, Lord Cecil, A. B. Laud, and
others. And now published for the Public Good. By
Robert Ware, Gent. Dublin. 1683. 12mo. pp. 248."</p></blockquote>

<p>The work concludes with this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Now he that hath given us all our hearts, give
unto His Majesties subjects of these nations <i>an heart of
unity</i>, to quash division and separation; <i>of obedience</i>, to
quench the fury of rebellious firebrands: and <i>a heart
of constancy</i> to the Reformed Church of England, the
better to expel Popery, and to confound dissention.
<i>Amen.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>The last work, with reference to the first simile
of my note, which I shall mention, is that by
Zephaniah Smith, one of the leaders of the English
Antinomians:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Doome of Heretiques; or a Discovery of
Subtle Foxes who wer tyed Tayle to Tayle, and crept
into the Church to doe Mischiefe, &amp;c. Lond. 1648."
<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page97" name="page97">{97}</a></span></p>
<p>With regard to the second simile, see&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Trojan Horse, or the Presbyterian Government
Unbowelled. London. 1646. 4to. By Henry
Parker of Lincoln's Inn."</p>

<p>"Comprehension and Toleration Considered, in a

representing the 'Ecclesia Anglicana.')"</p></blockquote>

<p>The first edition was published in 1675. Thomas
Tomkins, Fellow of All Souls' College, was the
author; but the two editions are anonymous.</p>

<p>As to the Service Book, see the curious work
of George Lightbodie:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Against the Apple of the Left Eye of Antichrist; or
The Masse-Booke of Lurking Darknesse (<i>The
Liturgy</i>), making Way for the Apple of the Right
Eye of Antichrist, the Compleate Masse-Booke of
Palpable Darknesse. London. 1638. 8vo."</p></blockquote>

<p>Baylie's <i>Parallel</i> (before referred to) was a
popular work; it was first printed London, 1641,
in 4to.; and reprinted 1641, 1642, 1646, 1661.</p>

<p>As to "High Church" and "Low Church," see
an article in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> for last October,
on "Church Parties," and the following
works:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The True Character of a Churchman, showing the
False Pretences to that Name. By Dr. West." (No
date. 1702?) Answered by Sacheverell in "The
Character of a Low Churchman. 4to. 1702." "Low
Churchmen vindicated from the Charge of being no
Churchmen. London. 1706. 8vo. By John Handcock,
D.D., Rector of St. Margaret's, Lothbury."</p>

<p>"Inquiry into the Duty of a Low Churchman.
London. 1711. 8vo." (By James Peirce, a Nonconformist
divine, largely quoted in <i>The Scourge</i>: where
he is spoken of as "A gentleman of figure, of the most
apostolical moderation, of the most Christian temper,
and is esteemed as the Evangelical Doctor of the Presbyterians
in this kingdom," &amp;c.&mdash;P. 342.)</p></blockquote>

<p>He also wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Loyalty, Integrity, and Ingenuity of High
Churchmen and Dissenters, and their respective
Writers, Compared. London. 1719. 8vo."</p></blockquote>

<p>See also the following periodical, which Lowndes
thus describes:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>The Independent Whig.</i> From Jan. 20, 1719-20,
to Jan. 4, 1721. 53 Numbers. London. Written by
Gordon and Trenchard in order to oppose the High
Church Party; 1732-5, 12mo., 2 vols.; 1753, 12mo.,
4 vols."</p></blockquote>

<p>Will some correspondent kindly furnish me
with the date, author's name, &amp;c., of the pamphlet
entitled <i>Merciful Judgments of High Church
Triumphant on Offending Clergymen and others in
the Reign of Charles I.</i>?<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p>I omitted Wordsworth's lines in my first note:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i16">"<i>High</i> and <i>Low</i>,</p>
<p class="i0">Watchwords of party, on all tongues are rife;</p>
<p class="i2">As if a Church, though sprung from heaven, must owe</p>
<p class="i0">To opposites and fierce extremes her life;&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Not to the golden mean and quiet flow</p>
<p class="i0">Of truths, that soften hatred, temper strife."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Wordsworth, and most Anglican writers down
to Dr. Hook, are ever extolling the Golden Mean
and the moderation of the Church of England. A
fine old writer of the same Church (Dr. Joseph
Beaumont) seems to think that this love of the
Mean can be carried too far:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"And witty too in self-delusion, we</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Not having the fear of Sir Roger Twisden
or <span class="smcap">Mr. Thomas Collis</span> before my eyes, I advisedly
made what the latter gentleman is pleased
to term a "loose statement" (Vol. viii., p. 631.),
when I spoke of the Church of England separating
from Rome. As to the Romanists "conforming"
for the first twelve (or as some have it nineteen)
years of Elizabeth's reign, the less said about that
the better for both parties, and especially for the
dominant party.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Collis's</span> dogmatic assertions, that the Roman
Catholics "conformed" for the twelve years,
and that Popes Paul IV. and Pius IV. offered to
confirm the Book of Common Prayer if Elizabeth
would acknowledge the papal supremacy, are evidently
borrowed, word for word, from Dr. Wordsworth's<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
<i>Theophilus Anglicanus</i>, cap. vii. p. 219. A
careful examination of the evidence adduced in
support of the latter assertion, shows it to be of
the most flimsy description, and refers it to its
true basis, viz. <i>hearsay</i>: the reasoning and inferences
which prop the evidence are equally flimsy.</p>

<p>Fuller, speaking of this report, says that it
originated with "some who love to feign what
they cannot find, that they may never appear to
be at a loss." (<i>Ch. Hist.</i>, b. <span class="smcap">ix.</span> 69.)</p>

<p>As the question at issue is one of great historical
importance, I am prepared, if called on, to
give a summary of the case in all its bearings;
for the present I content myself with giving the

<p> The titles of these books remind one of "a merry
disport," which formerly took place in the hall of the
Inner Temple. "At the conclusion of the ceremony,
a huntsman came into the hall bearing a fox, a pursenet,
and a cat, both bound at the end of a staff, attended
by nine or ten couples of hounds with the blowing of
hunting-horns. Then were the fox and cat set upon
and killed by the dogs beneath the fire, to the no small
pleasure of the spectators." One of the masque-names
in this ceremony was "Sir Morgan Mumchance, of
Much Monkery, in the county of Mad Popery."

The symbolism of the brute creation is copiously
employed in Holy Scripture and in ancient writings, and
furnishes a magazine of arms in all disputes and party
controversies. Thus, the strange sculptures on <i>misereres</i>,
&amp;c. are ascribed to contests between the secular
and regular clergy: and thus Dryden, in his polemical
poem of <i>The Hind and the Panther</i>, made these two
animals symbolise respectively the Church of Rome
and the Church of England, while the Independents,
Calvinists, Quakers, Anabaptists, and other sects are
characterised as wolves, bears, boars, foxes&mdash;all that is
odious and horrible in the brute creation.

<h3>DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY.&mdash;SLAVERY IN
ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>Having come across an old <i>Daily Post</i> of Thursday,
August 4, 1720, I send you the following
cuttings from it, which perhaps you may think
worth insertion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ralign">"Hague, August 9.</p>

<p>"It was on the 5th that the first of our East-India
ships appear'd off of the Texel, four of the ships came
to an anchor that evening, nine others kept out at sea
till day-light, and came up with the flood the next
morning, and four more came in this afternoon; but
as they belong to the Chambers of Zealand, and other
towns, its thought they will stand away for the Maese.
This fleet is very rich, and including the single ship
which arriv'd about a fortnight since, and one still expected,
are valued at near seven millions of guilders
prime cost in the Indies, not reckoning the freight or
value at the sale, which may be suppos'd to make
treble that sum."</p>

<p>"We have an account from Flanders, that two ships
more are come in to Ostend for the new East India<span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99">{99}</a></span>
Company there; it is said, these ships touch no where
after they quit the coast of Malabar till they come
upon the coast of Guinea, where they put in for fresh
water; and as for those which come from China, they
water on the bank of the Island of Ceylon, and again
on the east shore of Madagascar; but that none of
them touch either at the Cape de bon Esperance, or
at St. Helena, not caring to venture falling into the
hands of any of the Dutch or other nations trading to
the east. These ships they say are exceedingly rich,
and the captains confirm the account of the treaty
which one of their former captains made with the
Great Mogul, for the settling a factory on his dominions,
and that with very advantageous conditions;
what the particulars may be we yet know not."</p>

<h3>ORIGINAL ROYAL LETTERS TO THE GRAND MASTERS
OF MALTA.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. viii., p. 558.)</p>

<p>I am now enabled to forward, according to my
promise, literal translations, so far as they could
be made, of three more letters, which were
written in the Latin language, and addressed by
Henry VIII. to the Grand Masters of Malta. The
first two were directed to Philip de Villiers L'Isle
Adam, and the last to his successor Pierino Dupont,
an Italian knight, who, from his very advanced
age, and consequent infirmity, was little
disposed to accept of the high dignity which his
brethren of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem
had unanimously conferred upon him. The life
of Dupont was spared "long enough," not only for
him to take an active part in the expedition which
Charles V. sent against Tunis at his suggestion,
to reinstate Muley Hassan on the throne of that
kingdom, but also to see his knights return to the
convent covered with glory, and galleys laden
with plunder.</p>

<p class="center">No. IV. Fol. 6th.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hang1st">Henry by the Grace of God, King of England and
France, Defender of the Faith, and Lord of
Ireland, to our Reverend Father in Christ,
Dominus F. de Villiers L'Isle Adam, our most
dear friend&mdash;Greeting:</p>

<p>For a long period of time, Master Peter Vanes, of
<i>Luca</i>, has been serving as private secretary; and
as we have always found his service loving and
faithful, we not only love him from our heart,
and hold him dear, but we are also extremely desirous
of his interest and advancement. As he
has declared to us that his most ardent wish is by
our influence and favour to be in some way invested
with honour in his own country, we have
most willingly promised to do for him in this matter
whatever lay in our power; and we trust that
from the good offices which your most worthy
Reverence has always received from us, this our
desire with regard to promoting the aforesaid
Master Peter will be furthered, and the more
readily on this account, because what we beg for
may be granted without injury to any one. Since,
then, a certain Dominus Livius, concerning whom
your Reverend Lordship will be more fully informed
by our same Secretary, is in possession of
a Priory in the Collegiate Church of SS. John
and Riparata in the city of <i>Luca</i>, we most earnestly
desire that the said Livius, through your Reverend
Lordship's intercession, may resign the said Priory
and Collegiate Church to our said Latin Secretary,
on this condition, however, that your Reverend
Lordship, as a special favour to us, will provide
the said Dominus Livius with a Commandery of
equal or of greater value. We therefore most
earnestly entreat that you will have a care of this
matter, so that we may obtain the object of our
wishes; and we shall be greatly indebted to your
Reverend Lordship, to whom, when occasion offers,
we will make a return for the twofold favour, in a
matter of like or of greater moment.</p>

<p>Although, by many proofs, we have often before
been convinced that our Reverend Lordship,
and your venerable Brethren, after the loss of
Rhodes, have had nothing more to heart than that
by your actions you might deserve most highly of
the Christian republic, and that you might sometimes
give proof of this by your deeds, that you
have zealously sought for some convenient spot
where you might at length fix your abode; nevertheless,
what we have lately learnt from the letters
of your Reverend Lordship, and from the
conversation and prudent discourse of your venerable
Brother De Dentirville has caused us the
greatest joy; and although, with regard to the
recovery of Rhodes, complete success has not answered
your intentions, nevertheless we think that
this your Order of Jerusalem has always wished
to seek after whatever it has judged might in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100">{100}</a></span>
manner tend to the propagation of the Catholic
Faith and the tranquillity of the Christian Republic.
But that his Imperial Majesty has granted
to your Order the <i>island</i> of <i>Malta</i>, Gozo, and
Tripoli, we cannot but rejoice; places which, as we
hear, are most strongly fortified by nature, and
most excellently adapted for repelling the attacks
of the Infidels, should have now come into your
hands, where your Order can assemble in all
safety, recover its strength, and settle and confirm
its position.<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> And we wish to convince you
that fresh increase is daily made to the affection
with which we have always cherished this Order
of Jerusalem, inasmuch as we perceive that your
actions have been directed to a good and upright
end, both because these undertakings of your
Reverend Lordship, and of your venerable Brethren,
are approved by us as highly beneficial and
profitable; and because we trust that your favour
and protection will ever be ready to assist our
nation, if there be any need; nor shall we on our
part be ever wanting in any friendly office which
we can perform towards preserving and protecting
your Order, as your Reverend Lordship will

<p class="salute">Our most dear friend&mdash;Greeting:</p>

<p>We had conceived so great a hope and opinion
of the probity, integrity, and prudence of your
predecessor, that, from his care and vigilance, we
securely trusted that the business and affairs of
this your Order, which hitherto has always wont
to be of no slight assistance to our most Holy
Faith, and to the Christian name, would as far
as was needful have been amended and settled
most quietly and effectually with God and his
Holy Religion. From the love then and affection
which we have hitherto shown in no ordinary
manner to your Order, for the sake of the propagation
of the Christian Faith, we were not a
little grieved at the death of your predecessor,
because we very much feared that serious loss
would in consequence be entailed on that Religion.
But since, both from your letters and from the
discourse of others, we now hear that your venerable
Brethren agreed by their unanimous voice
and consent to choose your Reverence as the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101">{101}</a></span>person to whom the care and government of so
weighty an office should be intrusted, considering
this dignity to be especially worthy of you and
your spirit of Religion, we cannot but sincerely
be glad; and rejoice especially if, by your eminent
virtues, it shall be effected that only such matters
shall be undertaken, and presided over by the
strength and counsels of the Order of Jerusalem,
as are most in accordance with the True Religion
of Christ our Redeemer, and best adapted to the
propagation of his doctrine and Faith. And if
you shall seriously apply your mind to this, as
you are especially bound to, we shall by no means
repent of the favours which we have bestowed
neither seldom nor secretly upon this your Order,
nay rather this object shall be attained that you
shall have no reason to think that you have been
foiled in that your confidence, and in our protection
and the guardianship which we extend over
your concerns through reverence for the Almighty
God. And we shall not find that this guardianship
and protection of your Order, assumed by us,
has been borne for so long a period by us without
any fruit.</p>

<p>Those things which the Reverend Prior of our
Kingdom, and the person who brought your Reverend

with attention and kindness, and returned an
answer to, as we doubt not will be intimated by
them to your Reverend Lordship.</p>

<p>From the date and superscription of the above
truly Catholic letter, it will be seen that it was
written about the period of the Reformation in
England, and addressed to the Grand Master of an
Order, which for four centuries had been at all
times engaged in Paynim war; and won for itself
among the Catholic powers of Europe, by its many
noble and daring achievements, the style and title
of being the "bulwark of the Christian faith."
Bound as the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem
were in all ages to pay a perfect obedience to the
Roman Pontiffs, it is not surprising that this should
be the last letter which we have found filed away
in the archives of their Order, bearing the autograph
of Henry VIII.</p>

<p class="author smcap">William Winthrop.</p>

<p class="aucity">La Valetta, Malta.</p>

<div class="footnote">
  <a id="footnote5" name="footnote5"></a> <b>Footnote 5</b>:
    <a href="#footnotetag5">(return)</a>
<p> H. M. Henry VIII. was certainly labouring under
an error, when supposing that the islands of Malta and
Gozo "were strongly fortified by nature, and excellently
adapted for repelling the attacks of the infidels;"
as in truth nature had done nothing for their defence,
unless it be in furnishing an abundance of soft stone
with its yellow tinge, of which all their fortifications
are built.
</p><p>
When L'Isle Adam landed at Malta in October,
1530, it was with the rank of a monarch; and when,
in company with the authorities of the island, "he
appeared before its capital, and swore to protect its
inhabitants, the gates of the old city were opened, and
he was admitted with the knights; the Maltese declaring
to them their fealty, without prejudice to the
interests of Charles V., to whom they had heretofore
been subject." Never, since the establishment of the
Order, had the affairs of the Hospitallers appeared
more desperate than at this period. For the loss of
Rhodes, so famed in its history, so prized for its singular
fertility, and rich and varied fruits; an island
which, as De Lamartine so beautifully expressed it,
appeared to rise "like a bouquet of verdure out of the
bosom of the sea," with its groves of orange trees, its
sycamores and palms; what had L'Isle Adam received
in return, but an arid African rock, without palaces or
dwellings, without fortifications or inland streams, and
which, were it not for its harbours, would have been
as difficult to hold as it would have been unworthy of
his acceptance. (Vertot.)
</p><p>
A person who has never been at Malta can, by reading
its history, hardly picture to himself the change
which the island underwent for the better, under the
long and happy rule of the Order of St. John. Look
whither one will, at this day, he sees some of the most
perfect fortresses in the world,&mdash;fortifications which it
took millions of money to erect; and two hundred and
fifty years of continual toil and labour, before the work
on them was finished. As a ship of war now enters
the great harbour, she passes immediately under the
splendid castles of St. Elmo, Ricasoli, and St. Angelo.
Going to her anchorage, she "comes to" under some
one of the extensive fortifications of the Borgo, La
Sangle, Burmola, Cotonera, and La Valetta. In all
directions, and at all times, she is entirely commanded
by a line of walls, which are bristling with cannon
above her. Should the more humble merchantman be
entering the small port of Marsamuscetto, to perform
her quarantine, she also is sailing under St. Elmo and
Florianna on the one side, and forts Tigné and Manoel
on the other; from the cannon of which there is no
escape. But besides these numerous fortifications, the
whole coast of the island is protected by forts and batteries,
towers and redoubts. We name those of the
Red Tower, the Melleha, St. Paul, St. Julien, Marsa
Sirocco, and St. Thomas; only to show how thoroughly
the knights had guarded their convent, and how totally
different the protection of the Maltese was under their
rule, from what it was when they first landed; and
found them with their inconsiderable fort, with one
cannon and two falconets, which, as Boisgelin has mentioned,
was their only defence.</p>

<h3>ENAREANS.</h3>

<p>When Psammeticus turned back the conquering
Scythians from their contemplated invasion of
Egypt, some stragglers of the rear-guard plundered
the temple of Venus Urania at Ascalon.
The goddess punished this sacrilege by inflicting
on the Scythian nation the "female disease."
Herodotus, from whom we learn this, says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Scythians themselves confess that their countrymen
suffer this malady in consequence of the above
crime; their condition also may be seen by those who
visit Scythia, where they are called Enareæ."&mdash;Beloe's
Translation, vol. i. p. 112., ed. 8vo.</p></blockquote>

<p>And again, vol. ii. p. 261., Hippocrates says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"There are likewise among the Scythians, persons
who come into the world as eunuchs, and do all the
work of women; they are called Enaræans, or womanish,"
&amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>It would occupy too much space to detail here all
the speculations to which this passage has given
rise; sufficient for us be the fact, that in Scythia
there were men who dressed as, and associated
with, the women; that they were considered as
victims of an offended female deity; and yet,
strange contradiction! they were revered as
prophets or diviners, and even acquired wealth by
their predictions, &amp;c. (See <i>Universal History</i>,
xx. p. 15., ed. 8vo.)</p>

<p>The curse still hangs over the descendants of
the Scythians. Reineggo found the "female disease"
among the Nogay Tatars, who call persons
so afflicted "Choss." In 1797-8, Count Potocki
saw one of them. The Turks apply the same
term to men wanting a beard. (See Klaproth's
<i>Georgia and Caucasus</i>, p. 160., ed. 4to.) From
the Turkish use of the word "choss," we may infer
that Enareans existed in the cradle of their race,
and that the meaning only had suffered a slight
modification on their descent from the Altai. De
Pauw, in his <i>Recherches sur les Américains</i>, without
quoting any authority, says there are men in Mogulistan,
who dress as women, but are obliged to
wear a man's turban.</p>

<p>It must be interesting to the ethnologist to
find this curse extending into the New World,
and actually now existing amongst Dr. Latham's
American <i>Mongolidæ</i>. It would be doubly interesting
could we trace its course from ancient
Scythia to the Atlantic coast. In this attempt,
however, we have not been successful, a few
isolated facts only presenting themselves as probably
descending from the same source. The relations
of travellers in Eastern Asia offer nothing
of the sort among the Tungusi, Yakuti, &amp;c. The
two Mahometans (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 833, thereabout), speaking
of Chinese depravity, assert that it is somehow
connected with the worship of their idols, &amp;c.
(Harris' <i>Collection</i>, p. 443. ed. fol.) Sauer mentions
boys dressed as females, and performing all
the domestic duties in common with the women,
among the Kodiaks; and crossing to the American
coast, found the same practised by the inhabitants
of Oonalashka (ed. 4to., pp. 160. 176.). More
accurate observation might probably detect its
existence amongst intermediate tribes, but want<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102">{102}</a></span>
of information obliges us here to jump at once
over the whole range of the Rocky Mountains,
and then we find Enareanism (if I may so term it)
extending from Canada to Florida inclusive, and
thence at intervals to the Straits of Magellan.</p>

<p>Most of the earlier visitors to America have
noticed the numerous hermaphrodites everywhere
met with. De Pauw (who, I believe, never was
in America) devotes a whole chapter to the subject
in his <i>Recherches sur les Américains</i>, in which
he talks a great deal of nonsense. It assisted
his hypothesis, that everything American, in the
animal and vegetable kingdoms, was inferior to
their synonymes in the Old World.</p>

<p>The calm and more philosophical observation of
subsequent travellers, however, soon discovered
that the so-called hermaphrodites were men in
female attire, associating with the women, and
partaking of all their labours and occupations.
Père Hennepin had already mentioned the circumstance
(Amstel. ed. in 12mo., p. 219.), but
he seems to have had no idea of the practice being
in any way connected with religion. Charlevoix
went a step farther, for speaking of those he met
with among the Illinois, he says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"On a prétendu que cet usage venait de je ne sais
quel principe de la religion, mais cette religion avait,
comme bien d'autres, prit sa naissance dans la corruption
du c&oelig;ur," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here he stopped, not caring to inform himself as
to the real origin of the usage. Lafitau says these
so-called hermaphrodites were numerous in Louisiana,
Florida, Yucatan, and amongst the Sioux,
Illinois, &amp;c.; and goes on,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Il y a de jeunes gens qui prennent l'habit de femme
qu'ils gardent toute leur vie, et qui se croyent honorez
de s'abaisser à toutes leurs occupations; ils ne
se marient jamais, ils assistent à tous les exercises où
la religion semble avoir part, et cette profession de vie
extraordinaire les fait passer pour des gens d'un ordre
supérieur et au-dessus du commun des hommes," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are not these, he asks, the same people as those
Asiatic worshippers of Cybele? or those who, according
to Julius Firmicus, consecrated themselves,
the one to the Phrygian goddess, the others
to Venus Urania?&mdash;priests who dressed as women,
&amp;c. (See <i>M&oelig;urs des Sauvages américains</i>, vol. i.
p. 52., ed. 4to., Paris, 1724.) He farther tells us
that Vasco Nuñez de Balbao met many of them,
and in the fury of his religious zeal had them torn
to pieces by dogs. Was this in Darien? I believe
neither Heckewelder, Adair, Colden, nor
J. Dunn Hunter, mention this subject, though
they must all have been aware of the existence of
Enareans in some one or more of the tribes with
which they were acquainted; and I do not remember
having ever met with mention of them
among the Indian nations of New England, and
Tanner testifies to their existence amongst the
Chepewa and Ottawa nations, by whom they are
called A-go-kwa. Catlin met with them among
the Sioux, and gives a sketch of a dance in honour
of the I-coo-coo, as they call them. Southey
speaks of them among the Guayacuru under the
name of "Cudinas," and so does Von Martius.
Captain Fitzroy, quoting the Jesuit Falkner, says
the Patagonian wizards (query priests) are dressed
in female attire: they are chosen for the office
when young, preference being given to boys
evincing a feminine disposition.</p>

<p>Lafitau's conjecture as to the connexion between
these American Enareans and the worshippers of
Venus Urania, seems to receive some confirmation
from our next evidence, viz. in Major Long's
<i>Expedition to St. Peter's River</i>, some of these
people were met with, and inquiry being made
concerning them, it was ascertained that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Indians believe the moon is the residence of a
hostile female deity, and should she appear to them in
their dreams, it is an injunction to become Cinædi,
and they immediately assume feminine attire."&mdash;Vol. i.
p. 216.</p></blockquote>

<p>Farther it is stated, that two of these people whom
they found among the Sauks, though generally
held in contempt, were pitied by many&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"As labouring under an unfortunate destiny that
they cannot avoid, being supposed to be impelled to
this course by a vision from the female spirit that
resides in the moon," &amp;c.&mdash;Vol. i. p. 227.</p></blockquote>

<p>Venus Urania is placed among the Scythian
deities by Herodotus, under the name "Artimpasa."
We are, for obvious reasons, at liberty to
conjecture that the adoption of her worship, and
the development of "the female disease," may
have been contemporaneous, or nearly so. It
were needless entering on a long story to show the
connexion between Venus and the moon, which
was styled Urania, Juno, Jana, Diana, Venus, &amp;c.
Should it be conceded that the American <i>Mongolidæ</i>
brought with them this curse of Scythia,
the date of their emigration will be approximated,
since it must have taken place subsequently to
the affair of Ascalon, or between 400 or 500
years <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>The adoption of female attire by the priesthood,
however, was not confined to the worshippers of
Venus Urania; it was widely spread throughout
Heathendom; so widely that, as we learn from
Tacitus, the priests of the Naharvali (in modern
Denmark) officiated in the dress of women. Like
many other heathenish customs and costumes,
traces of this have descended to our own times;
such, for example, may have been the exchange
of dresses on New Year's Eve, &amp;c.: see Drake's
<i>Shakspeare and his Times</i>, vol. i. p. 124., ed. 4to.
And what else is the effeminate costume of the
clergy in many parts of Europe, the girded
waist, and the petticoat-like cassock, but a relique<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103">{103}</a></span>
of the ancient priestly predilection for female
attire?</p>

from an old newspaper reads with a strange significance
at the present time:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The last advices from Leghorn describe the genius
of discord still prevailing in the unfortunate city of
Constantinople, the people clamouring against their
rulers, and the janissaries ripe for insurrection, in consequence
of the backwardness of the Porte to commence

<p><i>Social Effects of the severe Weather, Jan. 3
and 4, 1854.</i>&mdash;The daily and local newspapers
have detailed many public incidents of the severe
weather of the commencement of 1854: such as
snow ten yards deep; roads blocked up; mails
delayed; the streets of the metropolis, for a time,
impassible; omnibuses with four horses; Hansom
cabs driven tandem, &amp;c. The effects of the storms
of snow, socially, were not the least curious. In
the neighbourhood of Manchester seventy persons
were expected at an evening party, one only
arrived. At another house one hundred guests
were expected, nine only arrived. Many other
readers of your valuable paper have, no doubt,
made similar notes, and will probably forward
them.</p>

that of the manger, both of which are in a crypt or
subterraneous chapel under the church of St. Katherine,
are in the hands of the Roman Catholicks. The former
is marked by this simple inscription on a silver star
set in the pavement:</p>

<p>'Hic de Virgine Maria Jesus Christus natus est.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The Emperor of the French, as representative
of the Latin Church, first raised the question of
the sacred places, now likely to involve the Pentarchy
of Europe in a <i>quasi</i> civil war, by attempting,
through the authority of the Sultan of Turkey,
to restore the above inscription, which had been
defaced, as is supposed, by the Greek Christians;
and thereby encountering the opposition of the
Emperor of the Russias, who claims to represent
the Eastern Church.</p>

(who in his discourse <i>De Excommunicato trucidando</i>
maintained that all refusers of the Covenant ought to
be excommunicated, and that all so excommunicated

<h3>THE STATIONERS' COMPANY AND ALMANACK.</h3>

<p>Having recently had occasion to consult the
Lansdown MSS., No. 905., a volume containing
documents formerly belonging to Mr. Umfreville,
I observed the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Ordinances, constitutions, rules, and articles made
by the Court of Star Chamber relating to Printers and
Printing, Jan. 23, anno 28 Eliz."</p></blockquote>

<p>Appended to these ordinances, &amp;c. is a statement
from which I have made the following extracts:</p>

<blockquote><p class="in4">"Viii<sup>o</sup> Januarii, 1583.</p>

<p>"Bookes yeilded into the hands and disposition of
the Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the Mysterie
of the Stationers of London for the releife of y<sup>e</sup> poore
of y<sup>e</sup> saide companie according to the discretion of the
Master, Wardens, and Assistants, or the more parte of
them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Barker, her Ma<sup>ties</sup> printer, hath yeilded unto
the saide disposition and purpose these bookes following:
viz.</p>

<p>"The first and second volume of Homelies.</p>

<p>"The whole statutes at large, w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> pamble as they
are now extant.</p>

<p>"The Paraphrasis of Erasmus upon y<sup>e</sup> Epistles and
Gospells appoynted to be readd in Churches.</p>

<p>"Articles of Religion agreed upon 1562 for y<sup>e</sup>
Ministers.</p>

<p>"The Several Injunctions and Articles to be enquired
of through y<sup>e</sup> whole Realme.</p>

<p>"The Profitt and Benefite of the two most vendible
volumes of the New Testament in English, commonlie
called Mr. Cheekes' translation: that is, in the volume
called <i>Octavo</i>, w<sup>th</sup> Annotacions as they be now: and
in the volume called <i>Decimo Sexto</i> of the same translation
w<sup>th</sup>out notes, in the Brevier English letter only.</p>

<p>"Provided that Mr. Barker himselfe print the sayde
Testaments at the lowest value by the direction of the
Master and Wardens of the Company of Stationers for
the tyme being. Provided alwaye that Mr. Barker
do reteyn some small number of these for diverse services
in her Ma<sup>ties</sup> Courtes or ... [MS. illegible]
and lastlye that nothing that he yeildeth unto by
meanes aforesaide be preiudiciall to her Ma<sup>ties</sup> highe
prerogative, or to any that shall succeed in the office
of her Ma<sup>ties</sup> printer."</p></blockquote>

<p>The other printers named are, Mr. Totell, Mr.
Watkins, Mr. John Daye, Mr. Newberye, and
Henrie Denham.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a Query upon the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. Watkins, now Wardein, hath yeilded to the
disposcion and purpose aforesaide this that followeth:
viz.</p>

<p>"The Broad Almanack; that is to say, the same to
be printed on one syde of a sheete, to be sett on walls
as usuallie it hath bene."</p></blockquote>

<p>Query 1. Is this <i>Broad Almanack</i> the original
of the present <i>Stationers' Almanack</i>?</p>

<p>2. When was this <i>Broad Almanack</i> first issued?</p>

<p>3. When were sheet almanacks, printed on one
side of a sheet, first published?</p>

<p class="author">B. H. C.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The books enumerated in this MS., under
the other printers' names, are some of them
very curious, and others almost unknown at the
present time.</p>

<h3>Minor Queries.</h3>

<p><i>John Bunyan.</i>&mdash;The following advertisement is
copied from the <i>Mercurius Reformatus</i> of June 11,
1690, vol. ii. No. 27.:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. John Bunyan, Author of the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>,

great Acceptance, hath left behind him Ten Manuscripts
prepared by himself for the Press before his

took place: that is, a publication of "ten manuscripts,"
of which none had been previously
printed?</p>

encamped on the banks of the Scarpe, medals
were struck, and distributed among the English,
bearing, besides a bust of the prince, an inscription

<p><i>Sir J. Wallace and Mr. Browne.</i>&mdash;I inclose an

result of the <i>fracas</i> between Mr. Browne and Sir

and Lieutenant <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, accidentally meeting in Parliament
Street, near the Admiralty Gate, Mr. <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span>,
the moment he saw Sir <span class="nowrap">J&mdash;&mdash;s</span>, took a stick which a
gentleman he was in company with held in his hand,
and, after a few words passing, struck Sir <span class="nowrap">J&mdash;&mdash;s</span>, and
gave him a dreadful wound in the forehead; they closed,
and Sir <span class="nowrap">J&mdash;&mdash;s</span>, who had no weapon, made the best defence
possible, but being a weaker man than his antagonist, was
overpowered. Mr. <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, at parting, told
Sir <span class="nowrap">J&mdash;&mdash;s</span>, if he had anything to say to him, he would
be found at the Salopian Coffee House. An account of
this transaction being communicated to Sir Sampson
Wright, he sent Mr. Bond after Mr. <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span>, who found
him at the Admiralty, and delivered the magistrate's
compliments, at the same time requesting to see him
in Bow Street. Mr. <span class="nowrap">B&mdash;&mdash;e</span> promised to wait upon Sir
Sampson, but afterwards finding that no warrant had
issued, did not think it incumbent on him to comply,
and so went about his avocations.</p>

<p>"Sir J&mdash;&mdash;s's situation after the fracas very much
excited the compassion of the populace; they beheld
that veteran bleeding on the streets, who had so often
gloriously fought the battles of his country! The
above account is as accurate as we could learn; but
should there be any trivial misstatement, we shall be
happy in correcting it, through the means of any of our
readers who were present on the spot.</p>

<p>"Sir James Wallace has not only given signal proofs
of his bravery as a naval officer, but particularly in a
duel with another marine officer, Mr. Perkins, whom
he fought at Cape François; each taking hold of the
end of a handkerchief, fired, and although the balls
went through both their bodies, neither of the wounds
proved mortal! The friars at Cape François, with
great humanity, took charge of them till they were
cured of their wounds."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester.</i>&mdash;I should be

Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Queen Elizabeth's

poisoned by his wife; by others <i>purposely</i>,
by some of his adherents. This affair,
though clouded in mystery, appears not to have
been particularly inquired into. Likewise let me
ask, on what authority is Stanfield Hall, Norfolk

his parentage? It may probably be interesting
to persons of the same name to be acquainted that
the <i>pears</i> worn by many of the Abbot family are
merely a corruption of the ancient inkhorns of
the Abbots of Northamptonshire, and impaled in
Netherheyford churchyard, same county, on the
tomb of Sir Walt. Mauntele, knight, and his wife
Elizabeth, daughter of John Abbot, Esq., 1487,
viz. a chev. between three inkhorns. The resemblance
between pears and inkhorns doubtless
occasioned the error. I believe the ancient bottles
of Harebottle were similarly corrupted into icicles.</p>

<p><i>Canaletto's Views round London.</i>&mdash;Antonio
Canaletto, the painter of Venice, the destruction

late the subject of so much agitation, was here
amongst us in this city one hundred years since;
as seen by his proposal in one of the journals of
1752:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Signior Canaletto gives notice that he has painted
Chelsea College, Ranelagh House, and the River
Thames; which, if any gentleman, or others, are pleased
to favour him with seeing the same, he will attend at
his lodgings at Mr. Viggans, in Silver Street, Golden
Square, from fifteen days from this day, July 31, from
8 to 1, and from 3 to 6 at night, each day."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is that able artist's offer in his own terms, if,
not his own words.</p>

<p>I have to inquire, are these pictures left here to
the knowledge of your readers? did he, in short,
find buyers as well as admirers? or, if not, did he
return to Venice with those (no doubt) vividly
pictured recollections of our localities under his

<p><i>A Monster found at Maidstone.</i>&mdash;In Kilburne's

in the time of King Richard the Second, was of this
town; and in the year 1206 about this town was a
monster found stricken with lightning, with a head
like an asse, a belly like a man, and all other parts far
different from any known creature, but not approachable
nigh unto, by reason of the stench thereof."</p></blockquote>

<p>No mention of this is made by Lambarde in his
<i>Perambulation of Kent</i>. Has this been traditional,
or whence is Kilburne's authority? And what
explanation can be offered of the account?</p>

But in an edition of Tacitus, with notes by Boxhorn

"whose like none else could show." Was this
description of fish peculiar to the Yare? and is
there any record of its having been esteemed a
delicacy in Elizabeth's reign?</p>

<p class="author">A. S.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>[This seems to be the fish noticed by Izaak Walton,
called the <i>Ruffe</i>, or <i>Pope</i>, "a fish," says he, "that is
not known in some rivers. He is much like the perch
for his shape, and taken to be better than the perch,
but will grow to be bigger than a gudgeon. He is an
excellent fish, no fish that swims is of <i>a pleasanter taste</i>,
and he is also excellent to enter a young angler, for
he is a greedy biter." In the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, book <span class="smcap">i.</span>
canto iv., Spenser speaks of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"His <i>ruffin</i> raiment all was stain'd with blood</p>
<p class="i0">Which he had spilt, and all to rags yrent."</p>
</div></div>

<p>To these lines Mr. Todd has added a note, which gives
a clue to the meaning of the word. He says, "Mr.
Church here observes, that <i>ruffin</i> is reddish, from the
Latin <i>rufus</i>.<span class="correction" title="missing quote added">"</span> I suspect, however, that the poet did
not intend to specify the <i>colour</i> of the dress, but rather
to give a very characteristical expression even to the
raiment of Wrath. Ruffin, so spelt, denoted a swashbuckler,
or, as we should say, a <i>bully</i>: see Minsheu's
<i>Guide into Tongues</i>. Besides, I find in <i>My Ladies'
Looking-Glasse</i>, by Barnabe Rich, 4to. 1616, p. 21., a
passage which may serve to strengthen my application
of <i>ruffin</i>, in this sense, to garment: "The yong
woman, that as well in her behaviour, as in the manner
of her apparell, is most <i>ruffian</i> like, is accounted the
most gallant wench." Now, it appears, that the <i>ruff</i>,
or <i>pope</i>, is not only, as Walton says, "a greedy biter,"
but is extremely voracious in its disposition, and will
devour a minnow nearly as big as itself. Its average
length is from six to seven inches.]</p></div>

<h2>Replies.</h2>

<h3>TRENCH ON PROVERBS.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., pp. 387. 519. 641.)</p>

<p>The courteous spirit which generally distinguishes
the communications of your correspondents,
renders the "N. &amp; Q." the most agreeable
magazine, or, as you have it, "medium of inter-communication
for literary men," &amp;c. I was so
much pleased with the general <i>animus</i> which
characterised the strictures on my proposed
translation of Ps. cxxvii. 2., that I was almost
disposed to cede to my critics, from sheer good-will
towards them. But the elder D'Israeli speaks
of such a thing "as an affair of literary conscience,"
which consideration prescribes my yielding in the
present instance; but I trust that our motto will
always be, "May our difference of opinion never
alter our inter-communications!"</p>

<p>I must however, at the outset, qualify an expression
I made use of, which seems to have incurred
the censure of all your four correspondents
on the subject; I mean the sentence, "The translation
of the authorised version of that sacred
affirmation is unintelligible." It seems to be perfectly
intelligible to <span class="smcap">Messrs. Buckton, Jebb,
Walter</span>, and <span class="smcap">S. D.</span> I qualify, therefore, the
assertion. I mean to say, that the translation of
the authorised version of that sacred affirmation
was, and is, considered unintelligible to many intelligent
biblical critics and expositors; amongst
whom I may name Luther, Mendelsohn, Hengstenberg,
Zunz, and many others whose names
will transpire in the sequel.</p>

<p>Having made that concession, I may now proceed
with the replying to my Querists, or rather
Critics. <span class="smcap">Mr. Buckton</span> is entitled to my first consideration,
not only because you placed him at the
head of the department of that question, but also
because of the peculiar mode in which he treated
the subject. My replies shall be <i>seriatim</i>.</p>

<p>1. Luther was not the first who translated
<span lang="he" title="ken iten liydido sheinah">
&#1499;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1513;&#1504;&#1488;</span> "Denn seinen Freunden gibt
er <i>es</i> schlafend." A far greater Hebraist than
Luther, who flourished about two hundred years
before the great German Reformer came into
note, put the same construction on that sacred
affirmation. Rabbi Abraham Hacohen of Zante,
who paraphrased the whole Hebrew Psalter into
modern metrical Hebrew verse (which, according
to a P.S., was completed in 1326), interprets the
sentence in question thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" style="margin-right: 35%">
<p class="i0 ralign"><span lang="he" title="ki ken yiten el teref">
&#1499;&#1497; &#1499;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500; &#1496;&#1512;&#1507;</span></p>
<p class="i0 ralign"><span lang="he" title="l'yidido ushnato meenehu lo taref">
&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1493;&#1513;&#1504;&#1514;&#1493; &#1502;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493; &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1512;&#1507;&#1475;</span></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"For surely God shall give food</p>
<p class="i0">To His beloved, and his sleep shall not be withheld from him."</p>
</div></div>

<p>2. It is more than problematical whether the
eminent translator, Mendelsohn, was influenced by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108">{108}</a></span>
Luther's <i>error</i> (?), or by his own superior knowledge
of the sacred tongue.</p>

<p>3. I do not think that the phrase, "the proper
Jewish notion of gain," was either called for or
relevant to the subject.</p>

<p>4. The reign of James I. was by no means as
distinguished for Hebrew scholarship as were the
immediate previous reigns. Indeed it would appear
that the knowledge of the sacred languages
was at a very low ebb in this country during the
agitating period of the Reformation, so much so
that even the unaccountable Henry VIII. was
forced to exclaim, "Vehementer dolere nostratium
Theologorum sortem sanctissime linguæ
scientia carentium, et linguarum doctrinam fuisse
intermissam." (<i>Hody</i>, p. 466.)</p>

<p>When Coverdale made his version of the Bible
he was not only aided by Tindale, but also by
the celebrated Hebrew, of the Hebrews, Emanuel
Tremellius, who was then professor of the sacred
tongue in the University of Cambridge, where
that English Reformer was educated; and Coverdale
translated the latter part of Ps. cxxvii. 2. as
follows: "For look, to whom it pleaseth Him, He
giveth it in sleep."</p>

<p>When the translation was revised, during the
reign of James I., the most accomplished Anglo-Hebraist
was, by some caprice of jealousy, forced
to leave this country; I mean Hugh Broughton.
He communicated many renderings to the revisers,
some of which they thoughtlessly rejected,
and others, to use Broughton's own phrase, "they
thrust into the margin." A perusal of Broughton's
works<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> gives one an accurate notion of the
proceedings of the revisers of the previous versions.</p>

<p>5. Coverdale's translation is not "ungrammatical"
as far as the Hebrew language is concerned,
notwithstanding that it was rejected in the reign
of James I. <span lang="he" title="lechem">
&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;</span>, "bread," is evidently the accusative
noun to the transitive verb <span lang="he" title="yiten">
&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;</span>, "He shall
give." Nor is it "false," for the same noun, <span lang="he" title="lechem">
&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;</span>,
"bread," is no doubt the antecedent to which the
word <i>it</i> refers.</p>

<p>6. Mendelsohn does <i>not</i> omit the <i>it</i> in his Hebrew
comment; and I am therefore unwarrantably
charged with supplying it "unauthorisedly." I
should like to see <span class="smcap">Mr. Buckton</span>'s translation of
that comment. If any doubt remained upon <span class="smcap">Mr.
B.</span>'s mind as to the intended meaning of the word
<span lang="he" title="yitenhu">
&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;</span> used by Mendelsohn, his German version
might have removed such a doubt, as the little word
<i>es</i>, "it," indicates pretty clearly what Mendelsohn
meant by <span lang="he" title="yitenhu">
&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;</span>. So that, instead of proving Mendelsohn
"at variance with himself," he is proved
most satisfactorily to have been in perfect harmony
with himself.</p>

<p>7. Mendelsohn does not omit the important word
<span lang="he" title="ken">
&#1499;&#1503;</span>; and if <span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> will refer once more to his copy of
Mendelsohn (we are both using the same edition),
he will find two different interpretations proposed
for the word <span lang="he" title="ken">
&#1499;&#1503;</span>, viz. <i>thus</i> and <i>rightly</i>. I myself
prefer the latter rendering. The word occurs
about twenty times in the Hebrew Bible, and in
the great majority of instances <i>rightly</i> or <i>certainly</i>
is the only correct rendering. Both Mendelsohn
and Zunz omit to translate it in their German
versions, simply because the sentence is more
idiomatic, in the German language, without it
than with it.</p>

<p>8. I perfectly agree with <span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> "that no
version has yet had so large an amount of learning
bestowed on it as the English one." But
<span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> will candidly acknowledge that the largest
amount was bestowed on it since the revision of
the authorised version closed. Lowth, Newcombe,
Horne, Horsley, Lee, &amp;c. wrote since, and they
boldly called in question many of the renderings
in the authorised version.</p>

<p>Let me not be mistaken; I do most sincerely
consider our version superior to <i>all</i> others, but it
is not for this reason faultless.</p>

<p>In reply to <span class="smcap">Mr. Jebb</span>'s temperate strictures, I
would most respectively submit&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That considerable examination leads me to
take just the reverse view to that of Burkius,
that <span lang="he" title="sheinah">
&#1513;&#1504;&#1488;</span> cannot be looked upon as antithetical
to <i>surgere</i>, <i>sedere</i>, <i>dolorum</i>. With all my searchings
I failed to discover an analogous antithesis.
I shall be truly thankful to <span class="smcap">Mr. Jebb</span> for a case
in point. Moreover, Psalms iii. and iv., to which
Dr. French and Mr. Skinner refer, prove to my
mind that not sleep is the gift, but sustenance and
other blessings bestowed upon the Psalmist whilst
asleep. I cannot help observing that due reflection
makes me look upon the expression, "So He
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109">{109}</a></span>giveth His beloved sleep," as an extraordinary
anticlimax.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Mr. Jebb</span> challenges the showing strictly
analogous instances of ellipses. He acknowledges
that there are very numerous ellipses even in the
Songs of Degrees themselves, but they are of a
very different nature. I might fill the whole of
this <i>Number</i> with examples, which the most scrupulous
critic would be obliged to acknowledge as
being strictly analogous to the passage under review;
but such a thing you would not allow. Two
instances, however, you will not object to; they
will prove a host for <span class="smcap">Mr. Jebb</span>'s purpose, inasmuch
as one has the very word <span lang="he" title="shena">
&#1513;&#1504;&#1492;</span> elliptically,
and the other the transitive verb <span lang="he" title="yitein">
&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;</span>, <i>minus</i> an
accusative noun. Would <span class="smcap">Messrs. Buckton, Jebb,
Walter</span>, and S. D. kindly translate, for the benefit
of those who are interested in the question, the
following two passages?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Rev. Henry Walter</span> will see that some of
his observations have been <span class="correction" title="'anticipitated' in the original">anticipated</span> and already
replied to. It remains, however, for me to
assure him that I never dreamt that any one would
suppose that I considered <span lang="he" title="sheinah">
&#1513;&#1504;&#1488;</span> anything else but
a noun, minus the <span lang="he" title="bet">&#1489;</span> preposition. The reason why
I translated the word "whilst he [the beloved]
is asleep," was because I thought the expression
more idiomatic.</p>

<p>S. D. attempts to prove nothing; I am exempt
therefore from disproving anything as far as he is
concerned.</p>

<p>Before I take leave of this lengthy and somewhat
elaborate disquisition, let me give my explanation
of the scope of the Psalm in dispute,
which, I venture to imagine, will commend itself,
even to those who differ from me, as the most
natural.</p>

<p>This Psalm, as well as the other thirteen entitled
"A Song of Degrees," was composed for
the singing on the road by those Israelites who
went up to Jerusalem to keep the three grand
festivals, to beguile their tedious journey, and
also to soothe the dejected spirits of those who
felt disheartened at having left their homes, their
farms, and families without guardians. Ps. cxxvii.
is of a soothing character, composed probably by
Solomon.</p>

<p>In the first two verses God's watchfulness and
care over His beloved are held up to the view of
the pilgrims, who are impressed with the truth
that no one, "by taking thought, can add one
cubit to his stature." The best exposition which
I can give of those two verses I have learned from
our Saviour's "Sermon on the Mount" (Matt. vi.
25-33.). The third and following verses, as well
as the next Psalm, are exegetical or illustrative.
To whom do you attribute the gift of children?
Is it not admitted on all hands to be "an heritage
of the Lord?" No one can procure that blessing
by personal anxiety and care: God alone can confer
the gift. Well, then, the same God who gives
you the heritage of children will also grant you all
other blessings which are good for you, provided
you act the part of "His beloved," and depend
upon Him without wavering.</p>

<p>The above is a hasty, but I trust an intelligible,
view of the scope of the Psalm.</p>

<h3>ARMS OF GENEVA.</h3>

<p class="center">(Vol. viii., p. 563.)</p>

<p>Your correspondent who desires the blazon of
the arms of the "town of Geneva," had better
have specified to which of the two bearings assigned
to that name he refers.</p>

<p>One of these, which I saw on the official seal
affixed to the passport of a friend of mine lately
returned from that place, is an instance of the
obsolete practice of <i>dimidiation</i>; and is the more
singular, because only the dexter one of the shields
thus impaled undergoes curtailment.</p>

<p>The correct blazon, I believe, would be: Or,
an eagle double-headed, displayed sable, dimidiated,
and impaling gu. a key in pale argent, the
wards in chief, and turned to the sinister; the
shield surmounted with a marquis' coronet.</p>

<p>The blazon of the sinister half I owe to Edmondson,
who seems, however, not at all to have
understood the dexter, and gives a clumsy description
of it little worth transcribing. He, and the
<i>Dictionnaire de Blazon</i>, assign these arms to the
Republic of Geneva.</p>

<p>The other bearing would, in English, be blazoned,
Checquy of nine pieces, or and azure: and
in French, <i>Cinq points d'or, équipollés à quatre
d'azur</i>. This is assigned by Nisbett to the
<i>Seigneurie</i> of Geneva, and is quartered by the
King of Sardinia in token of the claims over the
Genevese town and territory, which, as Duke of
Savoy, he has never resigned.</p>

<p>With regard to the former shield, I may just
remark, that the dimidiated coat is merely that of
the German empire. How or why Geneva obtained
it, I should be very glad to be informed;
since it appears to appertain to the present independent
Republic, and not to the former seignorial
territory.</p>

<p>Let me also add, that the plate in the <i>Dictionnaire</i>
gives the field of this half as argent. Mr.
Willement, in his <i>Regal Heraldry</i>, under the arms
of Richard II.'s consort, also thus describes and
represents the imperial field; and Nisbett alludes
to it as such in one place, though in his formal
blazon he gives it as <i>or</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing, in an heraldic point of view, would be
more interesting than a "Regal Heraldry of Europe,"
with a commentary explaining the historical
origin and combinations of the various bearings.
Should this small contribution towards such a
compilation tend to call the attention of any able
antiquary to the general subject, or to elicit
information upon this particular question, the
writer who now offers so insignificant an item
would feel peculiarly gratified.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p><i>Multiplying Negatives.</i>&mdash;In reply to M. N. S.
(Vol. ix., p. 83.) I would suggest the following mode
of multiplying negatives on glass, which I have every
reason to believe would be perfectly successful:&mdash;First,
<i>varnish</i> the negative to be copied by means of
<span class="smcap">Dr. Diamond's</span> solution of amber in chloroform; then
attach to each angle, with any convenient varnish, a
small piece of writing-paper. Prepare a similar plate
of glass with collodion, and drain off all superfluous
nitrate of silver, by standing it for a minute or so on
edge upon a piece of blotting-paper. Lay it flat upon
a board, collodion side upwards, and the negative prepared
above upon it, collodion side downwards. Expose
the whole to daylight for a single second, or to
gas-light for about a minute, and develope as usual.
The result will be a <i>transmitted positive</i>, but with reversed
sides; and from this, when varnished and treated
as the original negative, any number of negatives similar
to the first may be produced.</p>

<p>The paper at the angles is to prevent the <i>absolute</i>
contact and consequent injury by the solution of nitrate
of silver; and, for the same reason, it is advisable
not to attempt to print until the primary negative is
varnished, as, with all one's care, sometimes the nitrate
will come in contact and produce spots, if the varnishing
has been omitted. Should the negative become
moistened, it should be <i>at once</i> washed with a gentle
stream of water and dried.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly performed the operation above
described so far as the production of the positive, and
so perfect is the impression that I see no reason why
the second negative should be at all distinguishable
from the original.</p>

<p>I am, indeed, at present engaged upon a <i>similar</i>
attempt; but there are several other difficulties in my
way: I, however, entertain no doubts of perfect success.</p>

Towgood's paper of Mr. Sandford, who frequently
advertises in "N. &amp; Q." With regard to his other Query,
I think there can be no doubt of his being at liberty
to publish a photographic <i>copy</i> of a portrait, Mr. Fox
Talbot having reserved only the right to paper copies
of a <i>photographic</i> portrait. Collodion portraits are <i>not</i>
patent, but the <i>paper</i> proofs from collodion negatives
are.</p>

<i>Adulteration of Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;Will any of your
chemical readers tell me how I am to know if nitrate
of silver is pure, and how to detect the adulteration?
<i>If so</i> with nitrate of potash, how? One writer on
photography recommends the fused, as then the excess
of nitric acid is got rid of. Another says the fused
nitrate is nearly always adulterated. I fear you have
more querists than respondents. I have looked carefully
for a reply to some former Queries respecting
<span class="smcap">Mr. Crookes</span>'s restoration of old collodion, but at
present they have failed in appearance.</p>

<p><i>Major André</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 174. 604.).&mdash;The late
Mrs. Mills of Norwich (<i>née</i> André) was not the
sister of Major André; she was the only daughter
of Mr. John André of Offenbach, near Frankfort
on the Maine, in Germany; where he established
more than eighty years ago a prosperous concern
as a printer of music, and was moreover an eminent
composer: this establishment is now in the
hands of his grandson. Mr. John André was not
the brother of the Major, but a second or third
cousin. Mrs. Mills used to say, that she remembered
seeing the Major at her father's house as a
visitor, when she was a very small child. He
began his career in London in the commercial
line; and, after he entered the army, was sent
by the English ministry to Hesse-Cassel to conduct
to America a corps of Hessian hirelings to
dragoon the revolted Americans into obedience:
it was on this occasion that he paid the above-mentioned
visit to Offenbach.</p>

<p>Having frequently read the portion of English
history containing the narrative of the transactions
in which Major André was so actively
engaged, and for which he suffered, I have often
asked myself whether he was altogether blameless
in that questionable affair.</p>

<p><i>Catholic Bible Society</i> (Vol. ix., p. 41.).&mdash;Besides
the account of this society in Bishop Milner's
<i>Supplementary Memoirs of the English Catholics</i>,
many papers on the same will be found in the
volumes of the <i>Orthodox Journal</i> from 1813, when
the Society was formed, to 1819. In this last
volume, p. 9., Bishop Milner wrote a long letter,
containing a comparison of the brief notes in the
stereotyped edition of the above Society with the
notes of Bishop Challoner, from whose hands he
mentions having received a copy of his latest edition
of both Testaments in 1777. It should be
mentioned that most of the papers in the <i>Orthodox
Journal</i> alluded to were written by Bishop Milner
under various signatures, which the present writer,
with all who knew him well, could always recognise.
That eminent prelate thus sums up the fate
of the sole publication of the so-called Catholic
Bible Society:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Its stereotype Testament ... was proved to
abound in gross errors; hardly a copy of it could be
sold; and, in the end, the plates for continuing it have
been of late presented by an illustrious personage, into
whose hands they fell, to one of our prelates [this was
Bishop Collingridge], who will immediately employ
the cart-load of them for a good purpose, as they were
intended to be, by disposing of them to some pewterer,
who will convert them into numerous useful culinary
implements, gas-pipes, and other pipes."</p></blockquote>

correspondent <span class="smcap">Shirley Hibberd</span>. In the pure
breed there is not the slightest vestige of a tail,
and in the case of any intermixture with the
species possessing the usual caudal appendage, the
tail of their offspring, like the witch's "sark," as
recorded by honest Tam o' Shanter,</p>

<p>The breed of cats without tails is well known in
the Isle of Man, and accounted by the people of the
island one of its chief curiosities. These cats are
sought after by strangers: the natives call them
"Rumpies," or "Rumpy Cats." Their hind legs
are rather longer than those of cats with tails, and
give them a somewhat rabbit-like aspect, which
has given rise to the odd fancy that they are the
descendants of a cross between a rabbit and cat.
They are good mousers. When a perfectly tailless
cat is crossed with an ordinary-tailed individual,
the progeny exhibit all intermediate states
between tail and no tail.</p>

<p class="salute"><i>Warville</i> (Vol. viii., p. 516.).&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Jacque Pierre Brissot was born on the 14th Jan.,
1754, in the village of Ouarville, near Chartres."&mdash;<i>Penny

<p>If your correspondent is a French scholar, he
will perceive that Warville is, as nearly as possible,
the proper pronunciation of the name of this
village, but that Brissot being merely the son of a
prior pastrycook, had no right whatever to the name,
which doubtless he bore merely as a distinction from
some other Brissot. It may interest your American
friend to know, that he married Félicité
Dupont, a young lady of good family at Boulogne.
A relation of my own, who was very intimate with
her before her marriage, has often described her
to me as being of a very modest, retiring, religious
disposition, very clever with her pencil, and as
having received a first-rate education from masters
in Paris. These gifts, natural and acquired,
made her a remarkable young person, amidst the
crowd of frivolous idlers who at that time formed
"good society," not only in Paris, but even in
provincial towns, of which Boulogne was not the
least gay. Perhaps he knows already that she
quickly followed her husband to the scaffold. Her
sister (I believe the only one) married a Parisian
gentleman named Aublay, and died at a great
age about ten years ago.</p>

<p><i>False Spellings from Sound</i> (Vol. vi., p. 29.).&mdash;The
observations of <span class="smcap">Mr. Waylen</span> deserve to be
enlarged by numerous examples, and to be, to a
certain extent, corrected. He has not brought
clearly into view two <i>distinct classes</i> of "false
spelling" under which the greater part of such
mistakes may be arranged. One class arose <i>solely</i>
from erroneous pronunciation; the second from
<i>intentional</i> alteration. I will explain my meaning
by two examples, both which are, I believe, in
<span class="smcap">Mr. Waylen</span>'s list.</p>

<p>The French expression <i>dent de lion</i> stands for a
certain plant, and some of the properties of that
plant originated the name. When an Englishman
calls the same plant <i>Dandylion</i>, the sound has not
given birth "to a new idea" in his mind. Surely,
he pronounces badly three French words of which
he may know the meaning, or he may not. But
when the same Englishman, or any other, orders
<i>sparrow-grass</i> for dinner, these two words contain
"a new idea," introduced purposely: either he, or
some predecessor, reasoned thus&mdash;there is no
meaning in <i>asparagus</i>; <i>sparrow-grass</i> must be
the right word because it makes sense. The name
of a well-known place in London illustrates both
these changes: <i>Convent</i> Garden becomes <i>Covent</i>
Garden by mispronunciation; it becomes <i>Common</i>
Garden by intentional change.</p>

<p>Mistakes of the first class are not worth recording;
those of the second fall under this general
principle: words are purposely exchanged for
others of a similar sound, because the latter are
supposed to recover a lost meaning.</p>

<p>I have by me several examples which I will
send you if you think the subject worth pursuing.</p>

he will see that next Sunday, the 8th inst., stands
"Dom inf. Oct.," <i>i.e.</i> of the Epiphany, and that
the same occurs on other days during the year.</p>

<p>May I point out an erratum in a Query inserted

small castle near Kingsgate, Thanet, the name of
which is printed Aix Ruochim; it should be Arx

<p><i>Death Warnings in Ancient Families</i> (Vol. ix.,
p. 55.).&mdash;A brief notice of these occurrences, with
references to works where farther details may be
met with, would form a very remarkable record
of events which tend to support one's belief in
the truth of the remark of Hamlet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</p>
<p class="i0">Than are dreamt of in our philosophy."</p>
</div></div>

<p>A drummer is stated to be heard in C&mdash;&mdash;
Castle, the residence of the Earl and Countess of
A., "going about the house playing his drum,
whenever there is a death impending in the
family." This warning is asserted to have been
given shortly before the decease of the Earl's first
wife, and preceded the death of the next Countess
about five or six months. Mrs. Crowe, in her
<i>Night Side of Nature</i>, observes hereupon:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have heard that a paper was found in her (the
Countess's) desk after her death, declaring her conviction
that the drum was for her."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whenever a little old woman visits a lady of the
family of G. of R., at the time of her confinement,
when the nurse is absent, and strokes down the
clothes, the patient (says Mrs. Crowe), "never
does any good, and dies." Another legend is, that
a single swan is always seen on a particular lake
close to the mansion of another family before a
death. Then, Lord Littleton's dove is a well-known
incident. And the lady above quoted
speaks of many curious warnings of death by the
appearance of birds, as well as of a spectral black
dog, which visited a particular family in Cornwall
immediately before the death of any of its members.
Having made this Note of a few more
cases of death warnings, I will end with a Query
in the words of Mrs. Crowe, who, after detailing
the black dog apparition, asks: "if this phenomenon
is the origin of the French phrase <i>bête
noire</i>, to express an annoyance, or an augury of
evil?"</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous.</h2>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

<p>Mr. Wright's varied antiquarian acquirements, and
his untiring zeal, are too well known to require recognition
from us. We may therefore content ourselves with
directing attention to his <i>Wanderings of an Antiquary,
chiefly upon the Traces of the Romans in Britain</i>, which
has just been published, and of which the greater part
has appeared in a series of papers under the same title
in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>. It is intended to furnish,
in a popular form, a few archæological truths
which may foster a love of our national antiquities
among those who are less likely to be attracted by dry
dissertations: and its gossiping character and pretty
woodcuts are well calculated to promote this object.</p>

<p>This endeavour to make the study of antiquities
popular, naturally calls our attention to a small and
very agreeable volume on the subject of what Brand
designated <i>Popular Antiquities</i>. We refer to the last
volume of Bohn's <i>Illustrated Library</i>. It is from the
pen of Mary Howitt, and is entitled the <i>Pictorial
Calendar of the Seasons, exhibiting the Pleasures, Pursuits,
and Characteristics of Country Life for every
Month of the Year, and embodying the whole of Aikin's
Calendar of Nature</i>. It is embellished with upwards
of one hundred engravings on wood; and what the
authoress says of its compilation, viz. that it was "like
a walk through a rich summer garden," describes
pretty accurately the feelings of the reader. But, as
we must find some fault, where is the Index?</p>

<p>We have received from Birmingham a work most
creditable to all concerned in its production, and which
will be found of interest to such of our readers as
devote their attention to county or family history. It
is entitled <i>A History of the Holtes of Aston, Baronets,
with a Description of the Family Mansion, Aston Hall,
Warwickshire</i>, by Alfred Davidson, with <i>Illustrations
from Drawings</i> by Allan E. Everitt; and whether we
regard the care with which Mr. Davidson has executed
the literary portion of the work, the artistic skill of
the draughtsman, or the manner in which the publisher
has brought it out, we may safely pronounce it a
volume well deserving the attention of topographers
generally, and of Warwickshire topographers in especial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Folious Appearances; A Consideration
on our Ways of lettering Books</i>. Few lovers
of old books and good binding will begrudge half a
florin for this quaint opuscule.&mdash;<i>Indications of Instinct</i>,
by T. Lindley Kemp, the new number of the <i>Traveller's
Library</i>, is an interesting supplement to Dr.
Kemp's former contribution to the same series, <i>The
Natural History of Creation</i>.&mdash;We record, for the information
of our meteorological friends, the receipt of
a <i>Daily Weather Journal for the Year 1853</i>, kept at Islington
by Mr. Simpson.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115">{115}</a></span></p>

<p>C. K. P. (Bishop's Stortford). <i>We candidly admit that your
results upon waxed paper are much like our own, for no <em>certainty</em>
has at present attended our endeavours. If the paper is made
sensitive, then it behaves exactly as yours has done; and if, following
other formulæ, we use a less sensitive paper, then the exposure
is so long and tedious that we are not anxious to pursue Photography
in so "slow a phase". Why not adopt and abide by the
simplicity of the calotype process as given in a late Number? In
the writer's possession we have seen nearly a hundred consecutive
negatives without a failure.</i></p>

<p>W. S. P. (Newcastle-upon-Tyne). <i>Filtered rain-water is far
the best to use in making your iodized paper. The appearances

not <em>free</em> and <em>even</em> access to the whole sheet.</i></p>

<p>H. J. (Norwich). <i>Turner's paper is now quite a precarious
article; a specimen which has come to us of his recent make is
full of spots, and the negative useless. Towgood's is admirable for

<p>PIANOFORTES, 25 Guineas
each.&mdash;D'ALMAINE &amp; CO., 20. Soho
Square (established <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1785), sole manufacturers
of the ROYAL PIANOFORTES, at 25
Guineas each. Every instrument warranted.
The peculiar advantages of these pianofortes
are best described in the following professional
testimonial, signed by the majority of the leading
musicians of the age:&mdash;"We, the undersigned
members of the musical profession,
having carefully examined the Royal Pianofortes
manufactured by MESSRS. D'ALMAINE
&amp; CO., have great pleasure in bearing
testimony to their merits and capabilities. It
appears to us impossible to produce instruments
of the same size possessing a richer and finer
tone, more elastic touch, or more equal temperament,
while the elegance of their construction
renders them a handsome ornament for
the library, boudoir, or drawing-room. (Signed)
